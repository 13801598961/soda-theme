## Notes

There are some aspects of the theme design that aren't yet complete such as the Find / Replace button text colour. There are also other areas I would like to improve such as the overall quickpanel design.

At this stage, access to styling those features is either unvailable, limited, or I haven't figured out the correct rules.
