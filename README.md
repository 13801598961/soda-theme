# Soda Theme

A light coloured theme for Sublime Text 2.

## Installation

If you are a git user, the best way to install the theme and keep up to date is to clone the repo directly into your `/Packages/User` directory in the Sublime Text 2 application settings area.

### Using Git

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages/User` directory and clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/ "Theme - Soda"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Theme - Soda`
* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages/User` directory
* Open your Sublime Text 2 User Global Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> User Global Settings`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme"`

### Example User Global Settings

    {
        "theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme"
    }

## Design

## Notes

There are some aspects of the theme design that aren't yet complete such as the Find / Replace button text colour. There are also other areas I would like to improve such as the overall quickpanel design.

At this stage, access to styling those features is either unvailable, limited, or I haven't figured out the correct rules.

A summary of these areas can be found at the project wiki page [Theme Challenges and ideas](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/wiki/Theme-challenges-and-ideas).

## Legals

The theme contains some icons from the excellent [Pictos](http://pictos.drewwilson.com/) series by Drew Wilson which I have a license for. Any use of these icons, other than for the purpose of the theme itself, would need to comply with Drew's [icon licensing agreement](http://stockart.drewwilson.com/license/).
